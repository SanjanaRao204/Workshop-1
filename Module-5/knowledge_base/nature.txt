Nature is the foundation of life on Earth. It includes forests, rivers, mountains, oceans, plants, animals, air, and soil. Nature provides essential resources such as food, water, oxygen, and shelter that support all living beings. Ecosystems maintain balance through natural cycles like the water cycle and carbon cycle.

Biodiversity is an important part of nature, as different species depend on each other for survival. Forests produce oxygen, oceans regulate climate, and soil supports agriculture. Spending time in nature improves mental and physical health.

However, pollution, deforestation, and climate change are harming the environment. Protecting nature through conservation, reducing waste, and planting trees is essential for a sustainable future.
